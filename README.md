# A simple 'hello_world' for automating digital ocean VMs using Packer .
*(In Progress)*

I have been playing/working with virtual machines and cloud servers for a few minutes and i'm sick of repeating myself.

**Hey!** 

There's an **API !!**

#### Woot Woot!

**Status :** *Under Construction...*
* 1/13/16 - It works but it's rough.

### to run:
* clone the repo into a Cloud9 Virtual IDE.
* open terminal in project's root.
* bash SETUP_VM.bash
* exit terminal and open new terminal in project's root again.
* type packer to see command options.
