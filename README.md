# A simple 'hello world' for the digital ocean api (In Progress)

Would you like to view the gh-pages branch?

I have been playing/working with virtual machines and cloud servers for a few minutes and i'm sick of repeating myself.

Hey! There's an API!!

Woot Woot!

Status = Under Construction!

to run:
clone the repo into a Cloud9 Virtual IDE.
open terminal in project's root.
bash SETUP_VM.bash
exit terminal and open new terminal in project's root again.
type packer to see command options.
