figuring out the bash portion of the code, i found that perhaps using bash's 'echo' command is not "best-practice" when writing script.

I find this to be interesting knowledge.

Hmm, if i'm storing sensitive data using bash, i do not want my bash commands recorded. How does bash record commands any ways?

echo $HISTFILE

How do i turn this off?

To turn off : set +o history
Turn on : set -o history
